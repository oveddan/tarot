# The Tarot of Perception

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a single page app that provides a basic tarot reader.

The concept was based on Josef Alber's `Interaction of Color,` 
where two tarots next to each other, represented in different colors,
would affect the perception of each other due to the interactivity in their concepts and colors.
I ultimately abandoned it during development when I realized this prototype was failing to execute the concept.
The code is here just for documentation purposes.
